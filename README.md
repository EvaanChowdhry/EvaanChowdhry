Hello! ![hi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)
My name is Evaan, and I'm a programmer who loves to create random projects. I'm proficient in a variety of languages and tools, including Python, JavaScript, Bash, Node.js, and other languages.

Whether I'm working on a personal project or collaborating with others, I always strive to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and finding creative solutions to complex issues.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about the latest programming trends, and participating in online coding communities.

Feel free to take a look at some of my past projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in working together!
